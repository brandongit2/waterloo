                    The only way for \(\frac{\det(A_1)}{\det(A_2)}\) to not exist is to have \(\det(A_2)=0\). This would only be the case when \(S_3\) has a volume of zero (i.e., \(A_2\) transforms a shape of nonzero volume to one with zero volume). In all other cases, \(\frac{\det(A_1)}{\det(A_2)}\) exists.

                    \(A_1\) transforms an object from one that has a volume of 10 to one that has a volume of \(V\neq0\). So its determinant must be \(\frac{V}{10}\). Likewise, \(A_2\) transforms an object from one that has a volume of 4 to one that has a volume of that same \(V\). So its determinant must be \(\frac{V}{4}\). Putting these together, we get
                    \begin{align*}
                        \frac{\det(A_1)}{\det(A_2)}&=\frac{\frac{V}{10}}{\frac{V}{4}} \\
                        &=\frac{4V}{10V} \\
                        &=\frac{2}{5}
                    \end{align*}
                }
